        <h1 style="color: blue;"><center><h4><u>Akshay Kumar</u></h4></center></h1>
        <p style="font-size: medium; ">Akshay Kumar is a true example of how hard work and patience can get you to the very top. To be honest, his career in the 90s was not all that smooth sailing. Though he had big hits in the form of his ‘Khiladi’ films and ‘Mohra’, he had a huge number of flops in between as well. He was never really considered a competition for the three Khans back then. He once said in an interview that in spite of giving so many flops in a row, the only reason producers kept signing him was because of his discipline and good conduct. And that eventually paid off and how! With 2 hit films, ‘Hera Pheri’ and ‘Dhadkan’ at the turn of the century, his career suddenly took off like never before. He was particularly praised for his comic timing in ‘Hera Pheri’. He has had huge hits like ‘Namastey London’, ‘Singh is King’, ‘Rowdy Rathore’ since then and has established himself as one of the most bankable stars of Bollywood. Along with commercial success, he has also been critically praised for his performances in movies like ‘Special 26’, ‘Holiday’, ‘Airlift’, ‘Rustom’, which made a lot of money as well. Akshay Kumar is truly at the best phase of his career right now and from here, he can only go up!</p>

        <p style="font-size: medium;">'Vettaiyan' featuring Rajinikanth in the lead role was released in theatres on October 10, and the film received a better response. Directed by TJ Gnanavel, the social drama explored the mass and class side of Rajinikanth, and it turned out to be a favorite film for fans. 'Vettaiyan' makers have been sharing regular videos from the film to keep the buzz on for the film, and they have shared 
            the BTS video of the subway fight scene in the latest one. The subway fight scene is one of the high moments in 'Vettaiyan', and the BTS video explains how the mass scene was filmed. Rajinikanth was seen keenly observing inputs from stunt master duo Anbarivu to reflect them in his own style, while it's Anirudh Ravichander's background score that lights up the fire to the fight scene.In 'Vettaiyan', Rajinikanth plays a dynamic and powerful character as an encounter specialist, while Amitabh Bachchan stands opposite him by opposing encounters. The action entertainer also has Manju Warrier, Fahadh Faasil, Rana Daggubati, Dushara Vijayan, Ritika Singh, and Rakshan among others. TJ Gnanavel's gripping screenplay received praise, but it's Rajinikanth and Fahadh Faasil's combination that seized hearts.</p>
