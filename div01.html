    <h1><u>About 10000 Coders</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">If you have completed your graduation or about to complete your graduation and thinking about your career, one of the first things that come into your mind is — Where should I go to learn the job skills?
        Many times we go to the nearest IT hub, find a good PG or hostel to stay and then find the best software training institute for freshers in that city to start learning.<a href="https://www.magicbricks.com/boys-hostel-in-kukatpally-housing-board-colony-hyderabad-pppfr">about boys-hostel-in-kukatpally-housing-board-colony-hyderabad-pppfr</a> All good! Assuming if you are not from the IT hub how much do you spend extra outside of your training — majorly for food and accommodation
        10000 Coders aims to teach fresh graduates from India to get into high paying software jobs. Our 6-month, live, interactive, online program gives the tools and training needed to get into a software development job. And the best part is students pay nothing if they don't get a job.</p>
